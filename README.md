# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Keras
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on comments left by students on Rate My Professors. Given the text of the student's comments, we are supposed to build a recurrent neural network model to predict the quality and difficulty scores that a student will assign. I implement techniques like transfer learning, data augmentation, web scraping, building our embedding layer, using pre-trained Glove embedding, etc. The end goal of this project was to experiment with various techniques and document all of them, whether they worked out or not. 



In the end, through this project, these are the key points that I  learned:
For solving problems in natural language, data is the most important thing. The more data we have, the better it gets for the model to get trained since the number of features through which the model could learn potentially increases.
I learnt that adding more layers to neural networks does not always help. Instead, it sometimes hurt the modelâ€™s performance. Therefore, one must strike a balance between the correct parameters and the number of layers and nodes.
I also learnt that data visualization is an excellent way of getting started with the project, something that I missed in our project.
