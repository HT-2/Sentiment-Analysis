# Sentiment-Analysis
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on comments left by students on Rate My Professors. Given the text of the student's comments, we are supposed to build a recurrent neural network model to predict the quality and difficulty scores that a student will assign. I implement techniques like transfer learning, data augmentation, web scraping, building our embedding layer, using pre-trained Glove embedding, etc. The end goal of this project was to experiment with various techniques and document all of them, whether they worked out or not.
